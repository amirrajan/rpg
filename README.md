## About

In this game, I made an incredibly simplified version of the popular game Pokemon. Though only two Pokemon can be chosen and type advantage was not implemented, menu navigation, battle sequences, and animations are present.

## DragonRuby

To create this game, I utilized the game engine DragonRuby. DragonRuby is an incredibly powerful game development engine that provides simplicity without taking away functionality. For more information, pleaes visit the following link:
